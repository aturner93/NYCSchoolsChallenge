# NYCSchoolsChallenge

This project uses public APIs for NYC high schools to generate and display a table of schools. When a row is tapped, SAT scores for that school are displayed if they exist.

NYCSchools.m - Contains the API calls and creates a publicly accessible schools array. This is used as the data model for the project.

SchoolsTableViewController.m - Displays the data in a UITableView. 


The main project is called ChaseTests. 
The unit tests are under ChaseTestTests (Not the best name in the world)
